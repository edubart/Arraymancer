## Storage convention

Either C or Fortran contiguous arrays are needed for BLAS optimization for Tensor of Rank 1 or 2
* C_contiguous: Row Major - Default for CPU. Last index is the fastest changing (columns in 2D, depth in 3D) - Rows (slowest), Columns, Depth (fastest)
* F_contiguous: Col Major - Default for CUDA. First index is the fastest changing (rows in 2D, depth in 3D) - Rows (fastest), Columns, Depth (slowest)
* Universal: Any strides

Historically Fortran and all optimized BLAS libraries used column-major layout by default.
Today Fortran, Matlab, R, Julia, OpenGL and CUDA uses column-major layout.
On the other hand, C, Python and several deep learning libraries (Numpy, Torch, Caffe) uses row-major layout.

On CPU, Arraymancer follows the C/Python crowd. A practical bonus is that Matrix-Vector multiplication should be faster (we traverse each column in a row then change row --> row change the slowest).
On CUDA, Arraymancer follows (temporarily) the column-major layout, as many CUBLAS in-place operations expect that layout. Rewrite rules will be used for "cuda()" proc so that, if possible, CudaTensors are initialized directly on the device with column-major layout and don't need conversion.
Arraymancer will use row-major on CUDA when CUBLAS operations are replaced with custom kernels.

## Pending issues
* Switch to full inline iterators: https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/2972
* Load images as tensors:
https://github.com/define-private-public/stb_image-Nim/issues/3

## Memory/Perf considerations
* Current CPUs cache line is 64 bytes. The Tensor data structure at 32 bytes has an ideal size.
However, every time we retrieve its shape and strides there is a pointer resolution + bounds checking for seq with constant length. See Data structure considerations section.

* Most copy operations (from nested arrays/seq, for slice assignments from nested arrays/seq or Tensor) uses iterators and avoid intermediate representation.

* `slicerMut` can be implemented with shallow-copy to avoid extra memory copies. This is done for single value assignments but not for assignment from Tensor or openarray: https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/2971 and https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/2972

* For mean / stdev, should I implement the numerically stable but slow Welford algorithm?

## Data structure considerations

* Shape and strides have a static size known at runtime. They might be best implemented as VLAs (Variable Length Array) from an indirection point of view. Inconvenient: 2 tensors will not fit in a cache line.

* For now, shallowCopies will be used only in strategic places, for example when we want to mutate the original reference but use another striding scheme in `slicerMut`. Slicing will not return views.
Contrary to Python, the compiler can do the following optimization:
  - Copy elision
  - Move on assignment
  - Detect if the original Tensor is not used anymore and the copy is unneeded.
If further no-copy optimizations are needed, move optimization with {call} can be used so the compiler automatically choose a no-copy version if only one reference exists: https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#ast-based-overloading-move-optimization

## CUDA considerations

* Reclaiming memory: currently all CudaTensors are created via new + finalizer. The finalizer proc is automatically used after (at a non-deterministic time) the object goes out of scope. In case there are memory leaks, it might be because a CudaTensor wasn't created by new, and so need a `=destroy` destructor proc. Discussions on IRC highlight that finalizer is enough for yglukhov's game engine.

* Default to column-major layout (Fortran order).
Internally CUDA/CuBLAS works with column major layout. Creating CudaTensor column-major by default may avoid temporary transpose allocation.

* Currently CudaTensor are shallow-copied by default.
From a consistency point of view it would be best if both Tensor and CudaTensor have the same behaviour.
WIP: Implementing value semantics with overloading the assignment operator:
https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#type-bound-operations
To avoid unnecessary allocation a no-copy assignment can be used if references are unique.
https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#ast-based-overloading-move-optimization

* Async operations
Operations on CUDA device ("Host -> GPU" copy, additions, substraction, etc) are non-blocking for the host.
Meaning the program can proceed with CPU computation.
"GPU -> Host" copy operation is blocking to avoid data races.

In the future, independant operations like A+B and C+D might be scheduled in different Cuda Streams for simultaneous processing.


## Coding-style
* Prefer `when` to `if` for compile-time evaluation
* Let the compiler do its job:
    - proc everywhere, without the `inline` tag
    - template if proc does not work or to access an object field
    - macro as last resort to manipulate AST tree or rewrite code
* Readibility, maintainability and performance are very important (in no particular order)
* Use functional constructs like `map`, `scanr` instead of `for loop` when you don't need side-effects or a iterator

## Features

* Implement a Tensor comprehension macro. It may be able to leverage mitems instead of result[i,j] = alpha * (i - j) * (i + j).

* Implement einsum: http://ajcr.net/Basic-guide-to-einsum/


## TODO
1. Tests for array creation utilities (zeros, ones, zeros_like, random ...)
2. Tests for axis iterators
3. GPU support: Cuda and Magma first. OpenCL/ROCm when AMD gets its act together.
4. BLAS operation fusion: `transpose(A) * B` or `Ax + y` should be fused in one operation.

999. (Needs thinking) Support sparse matrices. There is Magma and CuSparse for GPU. What to use for CPU? Interface should be similar to BLAS and should compile on ARM/embedded devices like Jetson TX1.

## Ideas rejected

### Having an unified Tensor type instead of Tensor, CudaTensor, etc.

Rejected because of maintenance/difficult to debug errors. For example for this data structure:

```Nim
type
  Backend* = enum
    Cpu,
    Cuda

  Tensor*[B: static[Backend]; T] = object
    shape: seq[int]
    strides: seq[int]
    offset: int
    when B == Backend.Cpu:
      data: seq[T]
    else:
      data_ptr: ptr T

template shape*(t: Tensor): seq[int] =
  t.shape
```

The template will not compile due to "Cannot generate B", because due to the conditional when, Nim wants B in all proc declaration. The error points to the type declaration and not the proc declaration which makes it a pain to debug.

Furthermore the comparison operator "==" fails with "Cannot generate B" and I found no solution to that.

Also having more independant types will probably be easier for future features (distributed compute, MPI ?).

### Have the rank of the Tensor be part of its type.
Rejected because impractical for function chaining.
    Advantage: Dispatch and compatibility checking at compile time (Matrix * Matrix and Matrix * Vec)
### Have the kind of stride (C_contiguous, F_contiguous) be part of its type.
Rejected because impractical for function chaining. Furthermore this should not be exposed to the users as it's an implementation detail.

### Implement offsets and iterator using pointers.
Indexing with a strided array is basically doing a dot product. With a 3x3 matrix, strides are [3,1], in memory, element at position [1,2] will be at 3x1 + 1 x 2 -> 5th position (i.e. we did a dot product)

    > 0 1 2
    
    > 3 4 5

    > 6 7 8

After transposition, strides are [1, 3] and matrix shape:

    > 0 3 6

    > 1 4 7

    > 2 5 8

but the corresponding order in memory is still as before transposition. So pointer must jump by 3 twice, then minus 5, then jump by 3 twice, then minus 5. There is probably a mathematical formula behind but it's much easier and less error-prone to do a dot product, especially for high dimensions.

Since we will do a dot product anyway instead of shifting a pointer by a constant, just doing regular array/sequence indexing is better as we get automatic bounds checking, Nim future improvements and it's much easier to copy a Tensor, no need to recalculate the pointer address. We just need a way to provide a pointer to the beginning of the data to BLAS.

Perf note: from a perf point of view, (integer ?) dot product is vectorized on CPU and GPU, the stride seq will stay in cache, so perf is probably bounded by the non-contiguous memory access. Moving a pointer sometimes by x, sometimes by y, sometimes the other way would also be bounded by memory access (provided a correct and probably cumber some implementation)

### Shallow-copy by default:
Rejected until benchmarked otherwise.
If further no-copy optimizations are needed, move optimization with {call} can be used so the compiler automatically choose a no-copy version if only one reference exists: https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#ast-based-overloading-move-optimization

For CudaTensor, value semantics will be implemented.

`data` is currently stored in a "seq" that always deep copy on var assignement. It doesn't copy on let assignement.

If slicing shallow-copies by default like Numpy there is a risk of modifying the original array by mistake. Since Nim is compiled we can hope that the compiler detects cases where original tensor is not reused and moves instead of copying. Excellent read on value semantics vs reference semantics: https://akrzemi1.wordpress.com/2012/02/03/value-semantics/, https://juanchopanzacpp.wordpress.com/2014/05/11/want-speed-dont-always-pass-by-value/ and https://definedbehavior.blogspot.fr/2011/08/value-semantics-copy-elision.html.

References:
 - [Copy semantics](https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/1793/5) "Parameter passing doesn't copy, var x = foo() doesn't copy but moves let x = y doesn't copy but moves, var x = y does copy but I can use shallowCopy instead of = for that."
 - [Another](https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/1543) "First, it's important to understand that most of the time, you won't need shallowCopy at all. Copying is shallow by default if (1) the left-hand side of an assignment is a let variable or (2) the right-hand side is a function call."

Also using seq is far easier than implementing my own shallowCopy / refcounting code which would introduce the following questions:
- How to make sure we can modify in-place if shallow copy is allowed or a ref seq/object is used?
- To avoid reference counting, would it be better to always copy-on-write, in that case wouldn't it be better to pay the cost upfront on assignment?
- How hard will it be to maintain Arraymancer and avoid bugs because a copy-on-write was missed.

### Have polymorphic procs depending on a backend parameter
With the [following commit](https://github.com/mratsim/Arraymancer/blob/260386da01c9185f551f8afbe41d2c4beeeee92c/src/arraymancer/init_common.nim) in Cuda branch, all init procs accepted a backend parameter (Cpu, Cuda, ...). In case the backend had dedicated function like "zeros", this would avoid having to create tensor on the Cpu and then copy it to the backend.
The downside is
- Complicating the procs by the use of untyped templates, auto return types, "when t is Tensor" or "when backend is Cpu". This might promote spaghetti code.
- All new backends would require modification to the base procs, with more risks of introducing new bugs.
- In the case of "init" function, it requires the `check_nested_elements` proc in a file, then __Cpu__ and __Cuda__ specific code in another, then a __common__ file with the polymorphic procs. This would make it difficult to understand and contribute to the code.
- Only a few init functions can be used directly on GPU, **ones** and **randomTensor** will require creation on Cpu backend anyway
Two alternatives are possible to avoid that:
- Only provide the base proc for Cpu and have a rewrite rule to transform zeros(...).toCuda() into the direct Cuda function if it exists. (aka Composition)
- Use qualified import, like `ìmport arraymancer as arc` and `ìmport arraymancer/cuda as cu` and then `arc.zeros` or `cu.zeros`
