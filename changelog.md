Arraymancer v0.2.0 Sept. 24, 2017 "The Color of Magic"
===========================================

I am very excited to announce the second release of Arraymancer which includes numerous improvements `blablabla` ...

Without further ado:
- Communauty
   - There is a Gitter room!
- Breaking
   - `shallowCopy` is now `unsafeView` and accepts `let` arguments
   - Element-wise multiplication is now `.*` instead of `|*|`
   - vector dot product is now `dot` instead of `.*`
- Deprecated
   - All tensor initialization proc have their `Backend` parameter deprecated.
   - `fmap` is now `map`
   - `agg` and `agg_in_place` are now `fold` and nothing (too bad!)

- Initial support for Cuda !!!
   - All linear algebra operations are supported
   - Slicing (read-only) is supported
   - Transforming a slice to a new contiguous Tensor is supported
- Tensors
   - Introduction of `unsafe` operations that works without copy: `unsafeTranspose`, `unsafeReshape`, `unsafebroadcast`, `unsafeBroadcast2`, `unsafeContiguous`, 
   - Implicit broadcasting via `.+, .*, ./, .-` and their in-place equivalent `.+=, .-=, .*=, ./=`
   - Several shapeshifting operations: `squeeze`, `at` and their `unsafe` version.
   - New property: `size`
   - Exporting: `export_tensor` and `toRawSeq`
   - Reduce and reduce on axis
- Ecosystem:
   - I express my deep thanks to @edubart for testing Arraymancer, contributing new functions, and improving its overall performance. He built [arraymancer-demos](https://github.com/edubart/arraymancer-demos) and [arraymancer-vision](https://github.com/edubart/arraymancer-vision),check those out you can load images in Tensor and do logistic regression on those!

Also thanks to the Nim communauty on IRC/Gitter, they are a tremendous help (yes Varriount, Yardanico, Zachary, Krux).
I probably would have struggled a lot more without the guidance of Andrea's code for Cuda in his [neo](https://github.com/unicredit/neo) and [nimcuda](https://github.com/unicredit/nimcuda) library. And obviously Araq and Dom for Nim which is an amazing language for performance, productivity, safety and metaprogramming.


Minor revisions v0.1.1 to v0.1.3
